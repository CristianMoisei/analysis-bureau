        <p>The United States has often been a fertile ground for potent ideas whose consequences were felt far and wide. For instance, the American Revolution and its unequivocal rejection of autocracy paved the way for many other societies to become republics. The trade system and the world order that the Americans championed and continue to protect have improved living standards across the world while lifting millions out of poverty. At the same time, this is a nation that fought a bloody civil war before it could abolish slavery, and whose numerous interventions abroad have destabilised entire countries and resulted in millions of deaths.</p>
        <p>The country has weathered turbulent chapters and proven its resilience before, but many are wondering whether things are different this time and there are broader signs of decline.</p>
        <p>This article will analyse key data pertaining to the nation's health and will explore the implications of American decline, both at home and abroad.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Global factors</h3>

            <h3>Share of global GDP</h3>
            <p>At the end of the Second World War, the United States was the only advanced economy left standing, with the rest of the world either ravaged by war or lacking the production capabilities to be a serious contender. This gave Americans unprecedented economic power, a leading role in deciding the future of the global financial system, and the opportunity to benefit from the reconstruction of the world.</p>
            <p>According to British economist Paul Kennedy, the relative economic power of the United States is precisely the reason it enjoyed all these benefits. In his book, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, Kennedy argues that the bigger the share of global GDP a nation has, the easier it will be for it to achieve its global goals without overstretching its military and resources, while still investing at home and maintaining prosperity.</p>
            <p>Today, not only is the U.S.' share of global GDP decreasing, but that of its main rival, China, is increasing.</p>

            <script>renderChart("eh42A", true)</script>    

            <h3>Perception abroad</h3>
            <p>Like most nations, the United States' reputation abroad will fluctuate over time and will vary across countries. There are however broad trends that can be observed:</p>        
            <ul>
                <li><p>The president and his foreign policies have a large impact on perception abroad. The 2003 Iraq war strained relationships with western allies and it took until Obama's presidency for the outlook to recover. Trump's presidency again damaged the country's reputation, while Biden's election has restored optimism.</p></li>
                <li><p>The U.S. is respected for its technological achievements, entertainment, military and universities, but seen negatively when it comes to standards of living and health care. It is seen as a somewhat reliable partner but no longer considered a model for democracy.</p></li>
                <li><p>China's perception in the same countries is much worse, with an average of just 23% viewing it favourably in 2020.</p></li> <!-- https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/30/chinas-international-image-remains-broadly-negative-as-views-of-the-u-s-rebound/ -->
            </ul>

            <script>renderChart("l3HHl", true)</script>

            <h3>National debt</h3>
            <p>The national debt stands at $30.1 trillion as of February 2022, and while 21.5% of this is intragovernmental debt, it still translates to more than $90k for every person in the country and more than $240k for every taxpayer.</p>
            <p>A certain level of debt is healthy for a nation if it is used to fund projects that will generate greater returns in the future. In the case of the U.S., it's uncertain whether the returns will be able to cover the ever-growing debt without significant costs to future generations (e.g. via tax hikes, cuts to government programmes, etc.).</p>
            <script>renderChart("RxLwg")</script>

            <h3>Trade deficit</h3>
            <p>When it comes to trade, the U.S. has been running a surplus for services and a large deficit for goods. This could be seen as the nation making better use of its comparative advantage for services and growing wealthier after abandoning the limitations of the Bretton Woods system and the gold standard in 1971. However, this also resulted in stagnant wages for the middle class, the reduction of domestic manufacturing and increased inequality.</p>        

            <script>renderChart("tGddr")</script>

            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p>Over the last decades, changes to the landscape of global trade and its players have also been substantial. The value of total exports, grew from $382.6 billion in 1970 to $22 trillion in 2020. In that same period, the U.S. went from 15% of all exports to 9%, while China, after joining the WTO, grew its share of global exports from 0.6% to 12%.</p>

            <h3>Military power</h3>
            <p>The nature of war is changing and the U.S. military's defeats in asymmetrical conflicts in Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq point to difficulties adapting to the new reality. In conventional scenarios, the U.S. military remains the most powerful in the world, with rivals such as China and Russia catching up. </p>
            <p>Looking at a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States">timeline of engagements</a> the United States army is becoming less capable of achieving its goals abroad, but remains a formidable fighting force that will protect the nation and its interests.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Domestic factors</h3>

        <h3>Purchasing power</h3>
        <p>The real wages of the average American haven't seen any growth for a full half century now, from $25.9 in 1972. Real wages are adjusted for inflation based on the CPI (consumer price index), so taken in isolation, these numbers would only indicate that the average American can afford approximately as much food and entertainment as he did in 1972. What the CPI doesn't account for however is the price of assets, such as houses, or the real cost of some services such as healthcare. Real house prices, real healthcare costs and real higher education costs are all increasing at much higher rates than the average wage, which is contributing to falling living standards. This is despite employment rates and improving productivity. The consumer debt held by Americans has also increased from $9.14 trillion in 1999, out of which $5.49 trillion are mortgages, to $20.2 trillion in 2021, out of which $10.9 trillion are mortgages.</p>
        <script>renderChart("OeU1k")</script>
        
        <h5>Housing</h5>
        <p>The real price of an average house has grown from $180k in 1964 to $453k in 2021. To put this into perspective, in 1964 the average American would have to work 7,945 hours for a house, whereas today 16,960 hours would be required, which is an increase of 113%.</p>
        <script>renderChart("sMccB")</script>

        <h5>Healthcare</h5>
        <p>The real costs of healthcare have increased even more, from $231 billion or $1,245 per person in 1960 to $4.1 trillion or $12,530 per person in 2020. Even though healthcare costs are often covered by insurers and the government, the astronomical sums ultimately still fall on American society. The free market approach to healthcare is the biggest factor behind the increase. A sharp increase in obesity from 30.5% in 2000 to 42.4% in 2018 according to the CDC, an older population and an unhealthier diet are also contributing to rising costs. Some factors, like the number of smokers, are however falling.</p>
        <script>renderChart("JatiD")</script>

        <h5>Higher education</h5>
        <p>Americans also have more debt, student loan is needed for a career for most</p>
        <script>renderChart("kGsla")</script>

        <h3>Inequality</h3>
        <p></p>
        <!-- GDP is one of the most well known and monitored metrics, but it can be very misleading. For example it doesn't account for the size of the population. What about GDP per capita then? That assumes a perfectly even distribution of wealth, which is again, not realistic. That's why we'll look at GINI -->

        <script>renderChart("TC5ck", true)</script>

        <h3>Demographic pressure</h3>
        <p>Like other advanced economies, the U.S.' is facing pressure from demographic shifts. Life expectancy has increased by 9 years from 1960 to 2019, however the number of births per woman has fallen from 3.65 to 1.7 in the same period. This means that a shrinking workforce needs to support a growing retiree population with increasing healthcare costs. The U.S. is faring better in this area than most other developed nations.</p>

        <script>renderChart("nJwuW", true)</script>

        <h3>Crime</h3>
        <p>Despite the media focus on particular cases of crime, the national crime rate as of 2020 continues to decline from a peak in 1990. Homicides are the exception however, having increased by 22% in 2020, though still not reaching the levels in the 90s.</p>

        <h3>Homelessness</h3>
        <p>The national homeless population has been increasing since 2018, however it is lower than it was in 2007. At a state level, some states such as Michigan, Florida or Texas have seen considerable decreases in the homeless population, whereas states like New York, South Dakota, California or Idaho have seen increases.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion for global factors. none of these by themselves is enough to do any damage, but together they exert a lot of economic pressure and make it harder for the US to achieve its goals -->
    <!-- General conclusion: at the end: a lot of indicators do point to the US being in decline. What does the future hold? Several options -->
    <!-- At the end include a list of factors that were excluded and why: poverty rate, GDP -->
