            <p>There are growing fears that the turbulence the United States is facing is not transitory, and the consequences will be felt far and wide. From the allies who rely on its military might facing increasing risks of losing their autonomy and falling under the influence of other powers, to all the nations who benefit from the global trade network the US championed and continues to protect. Domestically, a period of relative decline would be felt even more, with reduced living standards and increased social tensions.</p>
            <p>But is the US truly in decline? Let's look at the numbers.</p>

                <!-- <h3 id="section-0">GDP per capita</h3>
                <p>GDP by itself is not the most adequate measure for a nation's prosperity. One of the criticisms is that it doesn't account for population growth. For example if, in a given period, GDP grew by 2% but the population grew by 5%, everyone will be worse off (assuming all other factors such as the balance of trade stay the same). There is also a lot of talk about China's economy soon overtaking the US, but China has 4.2x the population. GDP per capita doesn't account for wealth distribution (which we'll look at later), but it does at least account for changes in population.</p>

                <h3>Unemployment</h3>
                <p>While the uneployment rate climbed sharply during the early days of the pandemic, the recovery was also relatively swift, with the number sitting at <span class="bold">3.9% in December 2021</span> and an average of 5.36% for all of 2021. More importantly, the unemployment rate has always fluctuated historically and this doesn't point to broad signs of decline.</p>
