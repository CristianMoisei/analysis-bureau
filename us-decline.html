        <p>The United States has always been a fertile ground for powerful ideas. Some led to liberty and prosperity, while others brought opression and division. On one hand, the American Revolution and its unequivocal rejection of autocracy paved the way for many other societies to become republics. The trade system and world order that the Americans championed and continue to protect has improved living standards across the world and lifted millions out of poverty. At the same time, this is a nation that fought a bloody civil war before it could abolish slavery, and whose numerous interventions abroad have destabilised entire countries and resulted in millions of deaths.</p>
        <p>Whatever the U.S. does, the consequences are far reaching. And while the nation has proven its resilience before and has weathered other turbulent chapters, such as the Great Depression, many are wondering whether things are different this time and there are broader signs of irreversible decline.</p>
        <p>This article will explore the key numbers pertaining to the nation's stability and will consider the implications of American decline.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Global factors</h3>

        <h3>Share of global GDP</h3>
        <p>At the end of the Second World War, the United States was the only advanced economy left standing, with the rest of the world either torn down by war or lacking the production capabilities to be a serious challenge. This gave Americans unprecedented economic power, the opportunity to benefit from the reconstruction of the world and a leading role in deciding the future of the global financial system.</p>
        <p>According to British economist Paul Kennedy, the relative economic power of the United States is precisely the reason it enjoyed all these benefits. In his book, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, Kennedy argues that the bigger the share of global GDP a nation has, the easier it will be for them to, achieve their global goals without overstretching their military and resources, while on the other hand investing at home and maintaining prosperity.</p>
        <p>Today, not only is the US' share of global GDP decreasing, but the share of nations like China, whose interests often clash with American ones, is rapidly increasing.</p>

        <script>renderChart("yIjCj", true)</script>
        <script>renderChart("eh42A", true)</script>    

        <h3>Balance of trade</h3>
        <p>As the American share of global GDP is decreasing, the gap between exports and imports is increasing. On one hand, this could be regarded as a positive: from 1971, the nation was no longer hindered by the limitations of the Bretton Woods system and the gold standard, so it became free to leverage and expand its comparative advantage for services and grow even wealthier in the process. At the same time, this resulted in stagnant wages for the middle class, the reduction of domestic manufacturing and increased inequality.</p>        

        <script>renderChart("tGddr")</script>

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>The landscape of global trade and its players are changing also. The value of total exports grew from $382.6 billion in 1970, to $22 trillion in 2020. After joining the WTO, China's exports grew from 0.6% of all exports in 1970 to 12% in 2020. In the same period, the US went from 15% of all exports in 1970 to 9% in 2020.</p>

        <h3>Perception abroad</h3>
        <p>The United States' global reputation has fluctuated over time and it differs across countries. There are however broad trends that can be observed.</p>        
        <ul>
            <li><p>The president and his foreign policies have a large impact on perception abroad. The 2003 Iraq war strained relationships with western allies and it took until Obama's presidency for the outlook to recover. Trump's presidency damaged perception across the board, while Biden's victory has restored optimism.</p></li>
            <li><p>The U.S. is respected for its technological achievements, entertainment, military and universities, but seen negatively when it comes to standards of living and health care. It is seen as a somewhat reliable partner but no longer seen as a model democracy.</p></li>
            <li><p>China's perception in the same countries is much worse, with an average of just 23% viewing it favorably in 2020.</p></li> <!-- https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/30/chinas-international-image-remains-broadly-negative-as-views-of-the-u-s-rebound/ -->
        </ul>

        <script>renderChart("l3HHl", true)</script>

        <h3>National debt</h3>
        <p>The national debt stands at $30.1 trillion as of February 2022, and while 21.5% of this is intragovernmental debt, it still translates to more than $90k for every person in the country and more than $240k for every tax payer.</p>
        <p>A certain level of debt is healthy for a nation if it is used to fund projects that will generate greater returns in the future. In the case of the U.S., it's uncertain whether the returns will be able to cover the ever growing debt without significant costs to future generations.</p>
        <!-- Economists and lawmakers frequently debate how much national debt is appropriate. Most agree that some level of debt is necessary to stimulate economic growth and that there is a point at which the debt can become a problem, but they disagree about where that point is. If the debt does get too big, it can result in cuts to government programs, tax hikes, and economic turmoil.  -->
        <script>renderChart("RxLwg")</script>


        <h3>Military power</h3>
        <p>The nature of war is changing and the U.S. military's defeats in asymmetrical conflicts in Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq point to difficulties adapting to the new reality. On the conventional battlefield, the U.S. military remains the most powerful in the world, but rivals such as China and Russia are catching up. </p>
        <p>Looking at a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States">timeline of engagements</a> the United States army appears less capable of achieving its goals abroad, but remains a formidable fighting force that can defend the nation and its interests.</p>
