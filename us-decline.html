        <p>There are growing fears that the turbulence the United States is facing is not transitory, and the consequences will be felt far and wide. From the allies who rely on its military might facing increasing risks of losing their autonomy and falling under the influence of other powers, to all the nations who benefit from the global trade network the US championed and continues to protect. Domestically, a period of relative decline would be felt even more, with reduced living standards and increased social tensions.</p>
        <p>But is the US truly in decline? Let's look at the numbers.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Global factors</h3>

        <h3>Share of global GDP</h3>
        <p>At the end of the Second World War, the United States was the only advanced economy left standing, with the rest of the world either torn down by war or lacking the production capabilities to be a serious challenge. This gave Americans unprecedented economic power, the opportunity to benefit from the reconstruction of the world and a leading role in deciding the future of the global financial system.</p>
        <p>According to British economist Paul Kennedy, the relative economic power of the United States is precisely the reason it enjoyed all these benefits. In his book, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, Kennedy argues that the bigger the share of global GDP a nation has, the easier it will be for them to, achieve their global goals without overstretching their military and resources, while on the other hand investing at home and maintaining prosperity.</p>
        <p>Today, not only is the US' share of global GDP decreasing, but the share of nations like China, whose interests often clash with American ones, is rapidly increasing.</p>

        <script>renderChart("eh42A", true)</script>    

        <h3>Balance of trade</h3>
        <p>As the American share of global GDP is decreasing, the gap between exports and imports is increasing. On one hand, this could be regarded as a positive: from 1971, the nation was no longer hindered by the limitations of the Bretton Woods system and the gold standard, so it became free to leverage and expand its comparative advantage for services and grow even wealthier in the process. At the same time, this resulted in stagnant wages for the middle class, the reduction of domestic manufacturing and increased inequality.</p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>The landscape of global trade and its players are changing also. The value of total exports grew from $382.6 billion in 1970, to $22 trillion in 2020. After joining the WTO, China's exports grew from 0.6% of all exports in 1970 to 12% in 2020. In the same period, the US went from 15% of all exports in 1970 to 9% in 2020.</p>
