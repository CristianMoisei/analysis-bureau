                <h4>What's this site about?</h4>
                <p>It seems to me that it's getting harder and harder to know which news sources to trust or even to know what's real and what isn't. My goal with this website is to look at the <span class="bold">raw data</span> and give you the chance to <span class="bold">draw your own conclusions</span> about some of the most important issues of our time.</p>
